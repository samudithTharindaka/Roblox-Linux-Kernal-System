# Multiplayer Hacking System - Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Foundation (IMPLEMENTED)

### Core Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ **NetworkService** - Complete player registry and connection tracking
- ‚úÖ **Player Discovery** - Players can see who's online
- ‚úÖ **IP Management** - Each player gets unique IP address
- ‚úÖ **Connection Tracking** - Records all connection attempts with timestamps
- ‚úÖ **IP Blocking** - Players can block specific IPs

### Commands Implemented (6 new commands)

#### 1. `players` ‚úÖ
Lists all online players with their IP addresses, usernames, uptime, and security status.

```bash
$ players
Online Players:

IP ADDRESS      USERNAME       UPTIME    STATUS
-------------------------------------------------------
192.168.1.50    Player1        02h 30m   OPEN
192.168.1.75    Player2        01h 15m   SECURE
192.168.1.100   Player3        00h 45m   OPEN
```

#### 2. `whois <ip>` ‚úÖ
Get detailed information about a player by their IP address.

```bash
$ whois 192.168.1.50
Player Information for 192.168.1.50:

Username:      Player1
IP Address:    192.168.1.50
VM Uptime:     2h 30m
Public Access: Yes
Security:      VULNERABLE
Services:      ssh
```

#### 3. `passwd [new_password]` ‚úÖ
Change your password with strength validation.

```bash
$ passwd MyNewPassword123
Password updated successfully
Password strength: Medium

Your system is now moderately protected against attacks.
```

**Features:**
- Minimum 6 characters
- Checks against common weak passwords
- Calculates password strength (Weak/Medium/Strong)
- Strong passwords have better defense against brute force

#### 4. `block <ip>` ‚úÖ
Block an IP address from accessing your system.

```bash
$ block 192.168.1.50
IP address 192.168.1.50 has been blocked
```

#### 5. `unblock <ip>` ‚úÖ
Remove an IP from your block list.

```bash
$ unblock 192.168.1.50
IP address 192.168.1.50 has been unblocked
```

#### 6. `connections` ‚úÖ
View active connections and recent connection attempts.

```bash
$ connections
Network Connection Status:

Total Attempts: 15
Successful: 2  |  Failed: 13
Unique Attackers: 3
Blocked IPs: 1

Recent Connection Attempts (Last 5 minutes):

SOURCE IP       USER       METHOD        RESULT
-------------------------------------------------------
192.168.1.50    admin      bruteforce    FAILED
192.168.1.50    admin      bruteforce    FAILED
192.168.1.75    root       scan          FAILED
```

### Security Features

#### Attack Detection ‚úÖ
- Tracks all connection attempts per player
- Detects brute force patterns (5+ failed attempts in 1 minute)
- Rate limiting (max 3 attempts per 10 seconds)
- Historical tracking of all attacks

#### Audit Logging ‚úÖ
- All multiplayer actions logged
- Timestamps and source IPs recorded
- Integration with existing audit system
- Severity levels (info/warning/critical)

#### Password System ‚úÖ
- Secure password hashing
- Password strength validation
- Protection against common passwords
- Strength-based defense multiplier

## üöß Phase 2: Active Hacking (NEXT STEPS)

### What Needs to be Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced `bruteforce` Command
Currently the bruteforce command is simulated. Need to make it work against real players:

```lua
-- Pseudo-code for real implementation
bruteforce <ip> <username>
1. Find target player session
2. Check if IP is blocked
3. Try passwords from wordlist
4. Calculate success based on password strength
5. Alert target after 3 attempts
6. Store credentials if successful
```

#### 2. `ssh <username>@<ip>` Command
Allow logging into another player's system:

```lua
ssh admin@192.168.1.50
1. Check for stolen credentials
2. Verify password if not compromised
3. Create remote session
4. Switch command context to remote system
5. Alert target of unauthorized access
```

#### 3. Remote Command Execution
When logged in via SSH, commands should execute on target's system:
- Read their files
- Modify their filesystem
- Install backdoors
- Extract data

#### 4. `phish <player>` Command
Social engineering attacks:
- Send fake system alerts to target
- If they reply with password, capture it
- Report system for abuse prevention

#### 5. Message System
Inter-player communication:
- `msg <player> <message>` - Direct message
- `mail <player>` - Offline messages
- Inbox notifications

## üìã Quick Implementation Guide

### To Activate Multiplayer Features

**Server is already set up!** The new commands are registered automatically.

### For Players

1. **Set your password:**
   ```bash
   passwd YourSecurePassword123
   ```

2. **Discover other players:**
   ```bash
   players
   whois 192.168.1.50
   ```

3. **Defend yourself:**
   ```bash
   connections          # Monitor activity
   block 192.168.1.50   # Block attackers
   ```

4. **Check who's attacking:**
   ```bash
   authlog              # View authentication attempts
   connections          # See recent attempts
   ```

## üéÆ Current Gameplay Flow

### Scenario: Two Players Online

**Player A** (192.168.1.25):
```bash
$ players
# Sees Player B at 192.168.1.50

$ whois 192.168.1.50
# Gets info about Player B

$ scan 192.168.1.50
# Scans for open ports (existing command)
```

**Player B** (192.168.1.50) receives alerts:
```bash
$ connections
Recent Connection Attempts:
192.168.1.25    admin      scan          FAILED

$ block 192.168.1.25
IP address 192.168.1.25 has been blocked
```

**Player A** tries again:
```bash
$ whois 192.168.1.50
whois: Connection refused: IP blocked
```

## üîß Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

```
Player A                 NetworkService              Player B

### Storage

```lua
NetworkService = {
    onlinePlayers = {
        [userId] = {
            player, username, ip, vmUptime,
            isPublic, isSecure, services
        }
    },
    
    connectionAttempts = {
        [targetUserId] = {
            {sourceIP, timestamp, username, success, method},
            ...
        }
    },
    
    blockedIPs = {
        [userId] = {"192.168.1.25", "192.168.1.75", ...}
    }
}
```

## üìä Statistics & Tracking

### Already Tracking:
- ‚úÖ Total connection attempts per player
- ‚úÖ Successful vs failed logins
- ‚úÖ Unique attacker count
- ‚úÖ Blocked IPs count
- ‚úÖ Timestamp of each attempt
- ‚úÖ Method used (scan, bruteforce, etc.)

### Will Track (Future):
- Attack success rate per player
- Most targeted players
- Most active hackers
- Defense effectiveness
- Time to detect attacks

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Balance

### Current Balance:
- **Password Strength Matters**: Strong passwords are much harder to crack
- **Rate Limiting**: Max 3 attempts per 10 seconds
- **Detection**: 5 failed attempts = automatic alert
- **Defense Tools**: Block, monitor, audit logs all available

### Planned Balance:
- **Bruteforce**: 2-5 minute cooldown, costs 100 currency
- **Success Rate**: 70% weak / 30% medium / 5% strong passwords
- **Alerts**: Immediate after 3 attempts
- **Reputation**: Track hacker/defender scores

---

## üéì For Players: How to Play

### As a Defender:
1. Set a strong password (`passwd YourPassword123!`)
2. Monitor connections regularly (`connections`)
3. Block suspicious IPs (`block <ip>`)
4. Check audit logs (`authlog`)
5. Create snapshots before risky operations (`snapshot create backup`)

### As a Hacker: (Coming Soon)
1. Discover targets (`players`)
2. Gather intel (`whois`, `scan`)
3. Attempt access (`bruteforce`, `phish`)
4. Gain entry (`ssh`)
5. Achieve objectives (read files, plant backdoors)

### As Both:
- Help friends defend
- Form alliances
- Compete for reputation
- Learn security concepts
- Have fun!

## üìù Developer Notes

### File Locations:
- **NetworkService**: `src/server/Services/NetworkService.luau`
- **MultiplayerCommands**: `src/server/Commands/MultiplayerCommands.luau`
- **PlayerService** (updated): `src/server/Services/PlayerService.luau`
- **Server init** (updated): `src/server/init.server.luau`

### Integration Points:
- PlayerService passes networkService to all command executors
- Commands access via `context.networkService`
- RemoteEvent `SecurityAlert` for client notifications
- User class already has password hashing

### Testing:
1. Run in Roblox Studio with multiple windows (Alt accounts)
2. Each player gets unique IP automatically
3. Try `players`, `whois`, `passwd`, `connections`
4. Test blocking between players

---

## üéâ Ready to Test!

The foundation is complete! Players can now:
- See each other online
- Get information about each other
- Set passwords
- Block IPs
- Monitor connection attempts

**Next**: Implement actual hacking mechanics (bruteforce, ssh, phishing) to make it a real multiplayer hacking game!
